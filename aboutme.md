Bonjour! I'm a PhD student in causal inference and machine learning at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/mila/), co-advised by [Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io) and [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/yoshua-bengio/). I am interested in both fundamental and applied causal inference, especially applications to public policy.

Before starting my PhD at Mila, I did my Masters with Ioannis Mitliagkas at Mila. Before that, I was at University of Pennsylvania where I did the first 3 years of my Bachelors in machine learning before leaving to Mila.
