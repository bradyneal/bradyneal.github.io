**Disclaimer:** I have only read 4 of the 9 books in the flowchart below. However, I list the other 5 in the flowchart because I think I know enough about them to do so. You can read short reviews of the ones I read below under the "Mini Reviews" heading.

# Mini Reviews

I review the books below in roughly the order I read them.

### Elements of Causal Inference
This book is fantastic for those coming from a machine learning background. It even has two chapters dedicated to connecting causal inference to machine learning. This book is probably the best book for modern causal discovery (structure learning) techniques. While the term "causal inference" does not include causal discovery in other books, in this book it does. This is because a huge portion of this book is dedicated to causal discovery. And it still gives you a decent foundation in structural causal models (SCMs).

### Causal Inference: What If

This book is the most practical of all of the books I've read. For example, it is the only one that covers the concept known as "positivity" (or "overlap"), which is an important condition that must be satisfied in order to estimate causal effects. It is also the only book of these 4 that actually covers how to estimate the outcome models and propensity score models, which are used to estimate causal effects in practice. In fact, a huge chunk of this book is dedicated to different kinds of estimators that can be used in practice. In case you do not know, Jamie Robins (one of the authors) is a very important figure in epidemiology and causal inference more generally. For example, Judea Pearl credits him with the fact that the adjustment formula was implicit in his 1986 paper (the first time the adjustment formula can be discerned in the literature).

### Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer

This book is probably the best first book for the largest amount of people. It is a clear, gentle, quick introduction to causal inference and SCMs. Pearl is the first author, and he has made many important contributions to causal inference, pioneering SCMs.

### Causality

I'd only recommend this book to those who want to become expert in SCMs. Similarly, this book is unique in that it is the only book I'd recommend to those who are familiar with SCMs and want to become expert in them. It has a lot of great theory in it. It is often not an easy read. I imagine this would be near unreadable if you came to this book without any knowledge of SCMs or strong motivation to learn more about them. All that said, I think this book is often portrayed too harshly by people online. I suspect that many of these harsh reviews come from people who are not too interested in theory.
